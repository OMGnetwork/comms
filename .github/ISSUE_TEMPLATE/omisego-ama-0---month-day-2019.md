We kindly ask you to post every question as a single comment (one question = one comment) and upvote others youâ€™d like to see answered. The Top 5 questions will receive responses from the team before the end of the week. To allow time for team responses we will count votes every Monday (timing will be flexible at first, with adjustments in future AMA's).

**Rules:**

- Please do not reply to other comments in this thread until team responses have been posted;
- Use the search box and check previous AMAs to assure your question hasn't been asked before;
- If there are multiple questions in one comment, only one will receive a response;
- No trolling or abusive comments;
- There are reasons why some questions cannot be answered, upvote wisely;
- Please help our bot learn by following these [QnA guidelines](https://github.com/buildOMG/kb/blob/master/qna/qna_data.md).
