#### Technical Updates:

#### Plasma

The new year started off strong with a new iteration of the internal testnet. The improvements were based on the data and feedback received from the initial iteration. Our goal is to create a production environment that is resilient and can handle real-world continuous usage. While not the easiest task to do, we’ve made our first step in that direction with this version.

To ensure that we are prepared to open up to the real world -with multiple users, interactions, and connections, we’ve set up means to better study and view the chain, and develop iterations of it faster. The internal testnet is now fully monitored and instrumented with telemetry, logging, and exception reporting -allowing for faster feedback mechanisms and fixes. While we believe to have created a stronger environment now, we continue to actively test the new environment to build towards further resiliency.

The second half of January was focused on our More Viable Plasma (MoreVP) implementation. With our focus on MoreVP we are looking to ensure user funds (in ERC20) are safe. In line with that, we’ve been integrating the in-flight exit support from the root contracts into the child chain and watcher.

The MoreVP has all the production support services that we set up with our new internal testnet. Again, what this means is that we can continue to test and validate data and create solutions and new iterations faster. Along with our heavy security testing, we’ve also created an API format, which is consistent across the child chain, watcher, and eWallet so that it’s cleaner and more developer-friendly.

#### eWallet

For January we focused on the release process of eWallet 1.1. This entailed continuous testing, several bug fixes, and the thinking up and applying of last-minute features to add. We will continue to do this process till we’re satisfied with everything for release.

Of the accomplishments we’ve had in January there are three that stood out the most for the eWallet team:

First, it would have to be the finalization of the ‘Activity Log System’. This is an important feature that allows the users of the eWallet to know the exact details of all activities done. Users will be able to see who did what and when they did it. A good feature for accountability and an added measure of security.

Second, we’ve developed a better build process, which includes running the E2E tests. This is a great addition for developers as this provides a better and faster feedback loop. Working with this type of feedback loop will allow us to spot problems and fix them, ensuring less bugs are deployed into the staging system.

And last but certainly not the least, we have the CSV exports for transactions. While we may have not added any major features this month, the CSV export would have to be the closest one to it. This feature, which was initially required by one of our eWallet-using enterprise customers, provides the ability to export transactions for accounting purposes. Users can export any or all transactions that have been made.

#### ShinhanCard Proof-of-concept demo

video has sound

This was an exciting month for us as our exploration into possible technology applications with ShinhanCard has borne fruit. After months of collaboration with OmiseGO, the Korean Finance conglomerate demonstrates a cross-border PoC with the aim to expand the acceptance of ShinhanCard’s loyalty program to international markets and enable borderless interoperability.

This demonstration shows the first ShinhanCard transaction using OmiseGO. Should ShinhanCard choose to adopt the OMG Network with merchant acceptance, users would have the ability to interchange local loyalty points with other merchants and customers on the network across borders and eventually exchange between any digital asset, as per the design of the OMG Network.
